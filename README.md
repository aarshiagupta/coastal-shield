# 🌊 Coastal Shield

> **Beaches close after people get sick. Coastal Shield closes them before.**

Coastal Shield is a machine learning decision support system that predicts harmful algal bloom (HAB) risk along the California coast 14 days in advance, giving coastal health departments calibrated, audit-ready predictions with statistically guaranteed uncertainty bounds.

---

## The Problem

California beaches close reactively — after water testing confirms contamination, 48-72 hours after the bloom has already affected swimmers, shellfish, and marine mammals. The data to predict this 14 days early has existed since 1949.

The reason no predictive system exists for health officials isn't a data or model problem. It's a trust problem. A health official cannot defend a proactive beach closure based on "73% bloom risk." They can defend it based on a calibrated confidence interval, documented ocean variable attribution, and scientific corroboration — all in a format they can forward to their director. That's what Coastal Shield generates.

## What It Does

- **14-day HAB risk forecasts** per California coastal zone with conformal prediction confidence intervals (90% coverage guaranteed)
- **SHAP explainability** — which ocean variables drove each prediction and by how much
- **HABMAP corroboration** — cross-referenced against weekly Scripps/UCSD professional monitoring, the same data CDPH uses for shellfish advisories
- **Gemini-powered advisory memos** — formal PDF documents health officials can use to justify proactive closures
- **12-zone alert feed** — CLOSURE / ADVISORY / WATCH / MONITOR based on relative risk ranking

## Dashboard

The Streamlit dashboard shows all 12 monitored California coastal zones. Clicking any zone reveals:

- Ocean conditions radar chart normalized to the 70-year CalCOFI historical baseline
- Bloom risk gauge with conformal confidence interval
- SHAP waterfall feature attribution
- Key ocean metrics with σ anomalies vs seasonal baseline
- HABMAP scientific corroboration when available
- One-click Gemini advisory memo generation with PDF export

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/coastal-shield
cd coastal-shield/coastal_shield
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download CalCOFI data from [calcofi.org](https://calcofi.org/data/oceanographic-data/bottle-database/) and place `194903-202105_Bottle.csv` and `194903-202105_Cast.csv` in `data/raw/calcofi/`.

Create a `.env` file in `coastal_shield/`:
